## Code of Conduct

At ScribbleLab, we strive to create a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful community. Please review and adhere to our Code of Conduct. Disrespectful or harmful behavior will not be tolerated. Let’s work together to maintain a positive and collaborative space.

## How to Ask Questions

Before opening an issue, check our Support Guide.

- Questions about the app or troubleshooting your setup should be addressed in the Discussions tab.
- Issues should focus on bugs, enhancements, or specific feature requests (see below).

## Submitting Issues

Issues help us track bugs and plan improvements. Follow these steps for creating a clear, actionable issue:

### Reporting Bugs

Use the template: Fill out the provided issue template completely. This ensures we have all the context needed to address the problem efficiently.

- Provide details: Include the app version, OS version, reproduction steps, and screenshots or logs, if applicable.
- Search first: Avoid duplicates by checking existing issues. If your bug is already reported, add your input or react to the issue.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately via our Security Policy. Do not file it as a public issue.

## Feature Suggestions

Got an idea to make ScribbleLab even better? Fantastic! Submit a feature request by following these steps:

1. Search existing requests to avoid duplicates.
2. Use the feature request template to provide:

   - A clear description of the feature and its purpose.

   - How it complements existing features.

   - Mockups or examples, if applicable.

While we review all suggestions, not every idea will fit within our project's scope. We encourage meaningful discussion and contributions to help refine your idea!

## Submitting Pull Requests

We love contributions! Follow these guidelines to submit your pull request effectively:

1. Discuss first: For significant changes, open an issue or start a discussion before submitting code.
2. One thing at a time: Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or fix. Smaller, atomic changes are easier to review and integrate.
3. Testing matters: Ensure your changes include proper test coverage.
4. Documentation required: Update code comments and relevant documentation to reflect your changes.
5. Follow the style: Maintain consistency with the existing coding style (see below).

## Coding Style

Adhere to the coding style guidelines specified in our [style guide](). Consistent code enhances readability and simplifies maintenance.

To format your code, run `npm run format`.

## Writing Commit Messages

Great commit messages help maintainers understand your changes.
Here's the preferred format:

```md
(kind): Clear, concise summary of the change

Provide additional context if necessary. Explain the _why_ behind your changes, not just the _what_. Reference related issues when applicable.

Resolves: #issue_number
```

Example:

```md
(chore/security): Add AES-256 file encryption for secure notes

Improves security for sensitive content stored in the app. Uses a lightweight C library to ensure fast performance.

Resolves: #42
```

## Code Review Process

Code reviews are a cornerstone of maintaining quality.

- Be constructive: Review code, not the contributor. Offer actionable feedback and explain your reasoning.
- Timely responses: Address review comments promptly to keep the process efficient.

Our team aims to review pull requests within 3-5 business days. Larger changes may take longer.

## Acknowledgments

Your contributions make ScribbleLab better for everyone. Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, or submitting code, your efforts are deeply appreciated.

Let's collaborate and create something inspiring for the ScribbleLab community! 🚀
